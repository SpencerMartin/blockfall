Exploratory dabbling in Unity2D.

BE AWARE
This was an exploratory project over the course of 3 weeks (during senior year of college, so not continuous effort applied to it).
As such, you will notice it is fairly poor in quality. Things to note:

- There is no way to exit aside from closing it in-game.
- Hitting walls/blocks too hard halts the score counter
- The end screen should trigger, technically, but never does. 

In essence, don't expect anything out of this. Cheers.
